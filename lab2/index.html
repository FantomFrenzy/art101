					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenges we will face in this lab 
						is understanding how to use HTML and CSS. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>It was somewhat difficult to understand the instructions because 
						this HTML file had more content than what was shown in the instructions. 
						We took our time learning it and listening intently to the lecture. 
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>After taking some time to get familiar with how HTML and CSS work, 
						we were able to write and adjust the code to get the effects we wanted.
						We were able to figure out how to get what we wanted to happen much easier 
						after Tuesday’s lecture. We even added an image of Kirby since we are both 
						AGPM students and we wanted to do something extra. After that, it took some 
						trial and error to make sure everything was exactly how we wanted. Overall, 
						we think it turned out pretty well and we learned a lot about HTML and CSS
