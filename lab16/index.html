				<h1>Lab 16 - JSON and</h1>

				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge for this lab was to use AJAX to connect to an API and process 
					JSON from it so we can display parts of it on our webpage.
				</p>

				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>One problem we experienced was the XKCD API that we were originally 
					going to use was causing some errors, so we switched to the 
					NASA APOD API since it didn't have the same issue.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>After our initial struggles with the XKCD API, we were able to fairly 
					smoothly make the JS for this lab based on what we did in 
					class. It allowed us to learn connect to APIs and get and 
					display the specific JSON data we want using the data. function. 
					By adding the count: 1 to data section of the AJAX request, we were able
					to pull a random picture of the day.
				</p>
