					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge was to have a link connecting to lab3's index.html 
						from the website's (origin) index.html.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section3">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had problems connecting the sources/links together along with some other 
						designing aspects of the website's CSS. I managed to understand 
						a majority of it by consulting W3Schools.com and implement it 
						myself. However, I'm still confused on how to apply an automated 
						background audio for my website.

			<div class="minor-section3">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>After consulting W3Schools for the website's CSS portion, I'd say 
						that I now have a greater understanding on how this works. I'm still 
						confused about the audio part though.

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<h3>Task 1: Here are my file structure. I don't think my File Explorer can't
						open every file at once, so instead I took the screenshot at VSC.
