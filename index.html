			<h1> Ronie Antonio</h1>
			<p> Welcome to my website, friends. My name is Ronie Antonio, or if you prefer calling 
				me by my online alias, name's Fantom. I'm currently studying at UC Santa Cruz for my 
				AGPM (Game Design: Art) major and a possible CS minor. I consider myself to be an 
				avid artist, gamer (both casual and proffesional), and guide-maker.  
			</p>
			<p> I've always enjoyed playing video games, enjoying aspects ranging from its 
				gameplay, to visual aesthetics, to its storytelling, and even its accesssibility 
				to the player base. I love games, and I love creating art. That's why I'm 
				an AGPM major to begin with.
