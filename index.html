			<div class="mainpage">
				<p> Welcome to my website, friends. My name is Ronie Antonio, or if you prefer calling 
					me by my online alias, name's Fantom. I'm currently studying at UC Santa Cruz for my 
					AGPM (Game Design: Art) major and a possible CS minor. I consider myself to be an 
					avid artist, gamer (both casual and proffesional), and guide-maker.  
				</p>
				<p> I've always enjoyed playing video games, enjoying aspects ranging from its 
					gameplay, to visual aesthetics, to its storytelling, and even its accesssibility 
					to the player base. I love games, and I love creating art. That's why I'm 
					an AGPM major to begin with.
				</p>

					<p> Like I said, I enjoy creating art, mainly focusing on the environment, and what's 
						in the background. On the other hand, I struggle on character design and autonomy, 
						so I'll continue improving on that. Here are some samples of my artworks:
