				<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>

				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge for this lab was to create and call back both regular and 
					anomymous functions. Our functions were meant to perform mathematical 
					operations on the elements of an array we made
				</p>

				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>There were some slight issues in figuring out exactly how to use the 
					proper syntax, but everything else went smoothly.
				</p>
			

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This lab was very helpful for learning more about functions, anonymous 
					functions and callbacks. It also allowed us to experiment with the 
					.map() function.
				</p>

				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>Results are found here and in the console.</p>
