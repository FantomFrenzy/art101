			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge was for us to experiment with DOM manipulation by 
						using JavaScript and jQuery to make a button that generates random 
						Lorem Ipsum text when pushed and then display it.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We did not have many problems with this lab until we got to the 
						bonus task. It took us a while to figure out how to get the text 
						user was inputting to appear on the right side of the screen without 
						it looking weird or messing up the format
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was useful as it allowed us to experiment with DOM 
						manipulation and learn how to generate random sets of text. 
						It also allowed us to learn how to use jQuery to have users 
						input text as well as how to make inline block elements appear 
						on the right side of the screen.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Press the button and find out! (OuO)</p>
