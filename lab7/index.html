					<h4>Lab 7: Functions</h4>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge for this lab was for us to create a function that takes a 
						user's name as an input, sorts the letters of the name alphabetically, 
						and then display the sorted name of the user on the webpage.
					</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We were able to start the function by prompting by user to input their 
						name using window.prompt(). But we really didn't understand how to sort 
						the letters, since it was a string. We soon realized that converting the 
						string to some sort of array would make it work, so we decided to use 
						.split() and it was all smooth sailling then. We also wanted to shorten 
						the code (cause why not) so we just combined .split() + .sort() + .join() 
						together. 
					</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was extremely helpful for us as it showed us how to use functions 
						in a couple of ways. After following the instructions shown for Step 2, we 
						went out of our way to experiment with the function, finding different ways 
						we could utilize them (such as outputting a 'div' with a class that's styled 
						in CSS).
					</p>
