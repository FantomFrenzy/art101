			<div id="challenge" class="minor-section special-section">
				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge for this lab was for us to experiment with the jQuery 
					library and calling functions/elements from the library using $('').
					We were tasked to create toggleable buttons with event listeners 
					(which inverts the colors) and make it work.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="problems" class="minor-section special-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>We faced minimal problems in our code as we diligently followed each 
					instructions. We faced that problem when performing the bonus task, 
					where we were supposed to create a code that combines all the buttons.

			<div id="reflection" class="minor-section special-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Through this lab, we learned the importance libraries such as jQuery to 
					make our CSS and HTML document traversal and manipulation much simpler 
					and easy-to-use. Just like it shows in our JavaScript file, we managed 
					to reduce at least 15 lines of code down to less than 5. Just WOW.</p>

				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>Why don't you press the button and find out yourself. (OuO)</p>
