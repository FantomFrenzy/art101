					<h2>Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</h2>
					<img class="soul" src="img/kia_soul_2012.jpg">

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge for this lab was for us to experiment with Arrays [an ordered list 
						of data] and creating/attributing objects to certain properties (with specific 
						values). We also experimented a bit to get document.write() and JSON.stringify 
						to work.
					</p>
			
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We didn't really face much problems when creating arrays and objects in the browser 
						console or in the javascript file (only some typing issues lol).
					</p>
			
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>We found this lab very helpful as it showed us how to create/utilize arrays and objects 
						into our code. We found objects to be the most helpful for us as it would allow us to 
						structure more complicated data within our program. We didn't experience as much trouble 
						as expected, so we experimented with some other features/properties.
					</p>
