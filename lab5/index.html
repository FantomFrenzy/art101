					<h2>Lab 5: Data Types and Variables</h2>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge for this lab was for us to experiment with basic JavaScript 
						data types and variables. After assigning variables to a value in our browser
						console, we later had to experiment with the document.write() function in VSC.
					</p>
			
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We didn't really face any problems when using the browser console or linking  
						the JavaScript file to our HTML.
					</p>
			
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>We found this lab very helpful as it showed us how to create variables to hold 
						data and learned document.writeln() to neatly output them in our files. We didn't 
						experience as much trouble as expected, so we experimented with some other features.
					</p>
