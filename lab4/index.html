			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The lab had us thinking of how to do every task and how to make a 
						rock-paper-scissors game on the computer. Then we created psuedocode 
						for these tasks The lecture for pseudocoding was very helpful in 
						showing us the process.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We did not have many problems with the lab. The only minor issue 
						we had were making sure that the formatting of our lists was right 
						and coming up with all the steps we would need to take to make pizza 
						and create the rock-paper-scissor game.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab helped us familiarize ourselves with the process of pseudocoding, 
						which will let us better plan out our code in the future. We had to think 
						very hard about what steps we would need to put on the lists. We also learned 
						how to center an image on the page with CSS by looking at W3Schools.com.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>How to make pizza:</p>
					<p id="ex1">1. Gather ingredients (pizza dough, pizza sauce, cheese, toppings)</p>
					
					<p id="ex1">2. Preheat the oven 475°F</p>

					<p id="ex1">3. Prepare a baking sheet</p>

					<p id="ex1">4. Prepare the dough</p>	
					<p id="ex2">- Flour the surface</p>	
					<p id="ex2">- Roll/Stretch the dough</p>	
					<p id="ex2">- Place the dough on a baking sheet</p>

					<p id="ex1">5. Add sauce & cheese</p>
					<p id="ex2">- Spread a layer of pizza sauce evenly over the dough</p>	
					<p id="ex2">- Sprinkle a layer of cheese on top of the sauce</p>	

					<p id="ex1">6. Add toppings</p>
					<p id="ex2">- Evenly distribute the chosen toppings over the cheese</p>	

					<p id="ex1">7. Bake the pizza</p>
					<p id="ex2">- Place the pizza in the preheated oven</p>	
					<p id="ex2">- Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the pizza looks ready</p>	

					<p id="ex1">8. Finish up to serve</p>
					<p id="ex2">- Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool</p>	
					<p id="ex2">- Cut the pizza into slices</p>	
					<p id="ex2">- Serve the pizza</p>

// Creating a Rock-Paper-Scissors game (vs. computer, best of three):
	// Initialize the game
	// Accept player input/Generate computer move
		// Prompt player to choose between “rock”, “paper”, or “scissor”
		// Computer program randomly selects between “rock”, “paper”, or “scissor”
	// Determine the outcome
		// Compare the player’s choice with the computer’s
		// Apply the rules
			// Rock beats scissors
			// Scissors beat paper
			// Paper beats rock
		// Determine if the player won, lost or tied against the computer
	// Display the result
		// Announce the computer’s choice
		// Display the outcome of the interaction
		// Add 1 point to winner, no points if draw
	// Test of win or draw condition
		// Repeat from Step 2 until player/computer wins 2 out of 3 rounds
		// Prompt the player to play another set or quit
